# Generator

The purpose of this module is to generate boring classes to have a working entity real quick, instead of doing loads of copy pasta and having potential human errors

## Roadmap
* Add a condition to merge content with existing file. Can be useful when generating an entity in an existing module with already existing configurations (di.xml, db_schema etc...)
* Add IO to generator so we can maybe output the created files.
For example : Agranjeon\CustomEntity\etc\di.xml file has been created (or updated in the relevant case)
* Maybe add conditions to handle image fields ?
